al eraseblock to a physical eraseblock, the %UBI_IOCEBMAP
 * ioctl command should be used. A pointer to a &struct ubi_map_req object is
 * expected to be passed. The ioctl maps the requested logical eraseblock to
 * a physical eraseblock and returns.  Only non-mapped logical eraseblocks can
 * be mapped. If the logical eraseblock specified in the request is already
 * mapped to a physical eraseblock, the ioctl fails and returns error.
 *
 * Logical eraseblock unmap
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To unmap a logical eraseblock to a physical eraseblock, the %UBI_IOCEBUNMAP
 * ioctl command should be used. The ioctl unmaps the logical eraseblocks,
 * schedules corresponding physical eraseblock for erasure, and returns. Unlike
 * the "LEB erase" command, it does not wait for the physical eraseblock being
 * erased. Note, the side effect of this is that if an unclean reboot happens
 * after the unmap ioctl returns, you may find the LEB mapped again to the same
 * physical eraseblock after the UBI is run again.
 *
 * Check if logical eraseblock is mapped
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To check if a logical eraseblock is mapped to a physical eraseblock, the
 * %UBI_IOCEBISMAP ioctl command should be used. It returns %0 if the LEB is
 * not mapped, and %1 if it is mapped.
 *
 * Set an UBI volume property
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To set an UBI volume property the %UBI_IOCSETPROP ioctl command should be
 * used. A pointer to a &struct ubi_set_vol_prop_req object is expected to be
 * passed. The object describes which property should be set, and to which value
 * it should be set.
 *
 * Block devices on UBI volumes
 * ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
 *
 * To create a R/O block device on top of an UBI volume the %UBI_IOCVOLCRBLK
 * should be used. A pointer to a &struct ubi_blkcreate_req object is expected
 * to be passed, which is not used and reserved for future usage.
 *
 * Conversely, to remove a block device the %UBI_IOCVOLRMBLK should be used,
 * which takes no arguments.

 * @max_beb_per1024: maximum expected number of bad PEB per 1024 PEBs
 * @padding: reserved for future, not used, has to be zeroed
 *
 * This data structure is used to specify MTD device UBI has to attach and the
 * parameters it has to use. The number which should be assigned to the new UBI
 * device is passed in @ubi_num. UBI may automatically assign the number if
 * @UBI_DEV_NUM_AUTO is passed. In this case, the device number is returned in
 * @ubi_num.
 *
 * Most applications should pass %0 in @vid_hdr_offset to make UBI use default
 * offset of the VID header within physical eraseblocks. The default offset is
 * the next min. I/O unit after the EC header. For example, it will be offset
 * 512 in case of a 512 bytes page NAND flash with no sub-page support. Or
 * it will be 512 in case of a 2KiB page NAND flash with 4 512-byte sub-pages.
 *
 * But in rare cases, if this optimizes things, the VID header may be placed to
 * a different offset. For example, the boot-loader might do things faster if
 * the VID header sits at the end of the first 2KiB NAND page with 4 sub-pages.
 * As the boot-loader would not normally need to read EC headers (unless it
 * needs UBI in RW mode), it might be faster to calculate ECC. This is weird
 * example, but it real-life example. So, in this example, @vid_hdr_offer would
 * be 2KiB-64 bytes = 1984. Note, that this position is not even 512-bytes
 * aligned, which is OK, as UBI is clever enough to realize this is 4th
 * sub-page of the first page and add needed padding.
 *
 * The @max_beb_per1024 is the maximum amount of bad PEBs UBI expects on the
 * UBI device per 1024 eraseblocks.  This value is often given in an other form
 * in the NAND datasheet (min NVB i.e. minimal number of valid blocks). The
 * maximum expected bad eraseblocks per 1024 is then:
 *    1024 * (1 - MinNVB / MaxNVB)
 * Which gives 20 for most NAND devices.  This limit is used in order to derive
 * amount of eraseblock UBI reserves for handling new bad blocks. If the device
 * has more bad eraseblocks than this limit, UBI does not reserve any physical
 * eraseblocks for new bad eraseblocks, but attempts to use available
 * eraseblocks (if any). The accepted range is 0-768. If 0 is given, the
 * default kernel value of %CONFIG_MTD_UBI_BEB_LIMIT will be used.
