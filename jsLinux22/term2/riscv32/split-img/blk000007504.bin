 * Command Submission
 *
 * To submit work to the device, the user need to call this IOCTL with a set
 * of JOBS. That set of JOBS constitutes a CS object.
 * Each JOB will be enqueued on a specific queue, according to the user's input.
 * There can be more then one JOB per queue.
 *
 * The CS IOCTL will receive three sets of JOBS. One set is for "restore" phase,
 * a second set is for "execution" phase and a third set is for "store" phase.
 * The JOBS on the "restore" phase are enqueued only after context-switch
 * (or if its the first CS for this context). The user can also order the
 * driver to run the "restore" phase explicitly
 *
 * There are two types of queues - external and internal. External queues
 * are DMA queues which transfer data from/to the Host. All other queues are
 * internal. The driver will get completion notifications from the device only
 * on JOBS which are enqueued in the external queues.
 *
 * For jobs on external queues, the user needs to create command buffers
 * through the CB ioctl and give the CB's handle to the CS ioctl. For jobs on
 * internal queues, the user needs to prepare a "command buffer" with packets
 * on either the device SRAM/DRAM or the host, and give the device address of
 * that buffer to the CS ioctl.
 *
 * This IOCTL is asynchronous in regard to the actual execution of the CS. This
 * means it returns immediately after ALL the JOBS were enqueued on their
 * relevant queues. Therefore, the user mustn't assume the CS has been completed
 * or has even started to execute.
 *
 * Upon successful enqueue, the IOCTL returns a sequence number which the user
 * can use with the "Wait for CS" IOCTL to check whether the handle's CS
 * external JOBS have been completed. Note that if the CS has internal JOBS
 * which can execute AFTER the external JOBS have finished, the driver might
 * report that the CS has finished executing BEFORE the internal JOBS have
 * actually finished executing.
 *
 * Even though the sequence number increments per CS, the user can NOT
 * automatically assume that if CS with sequence number N finished, then CS
 * with sequence number N-1 also finished. The user can make this assumption if
 * and only if CS N and CS N-1 are exactly the same (same CBs for the same
 * queues).

/*
 * Wait for Command Submission
 *
 * The user can call this IOCTL with a handle it received from the CS IOCTL
 * to wait until the handle's CS has finished executing. The user will wait
 * inside the kernel until the CS has finished or until the user-requested
 * timeout has expired.
 *
 * The return value of the IOCTL is a standard Linux error code. The possible
 * values are:
 *
 * EINTR     - Kernel waiting has been interrupted, e.g. due to OS signal
 *             that the user process received
 * ETIMEDOUT - The CS has caused a timeout on the device
 * EIO       - The CS was aborted (usually because the device was reset)
 * ENODEV    - The device wants to do hard-reset (so user need to close FD)
 *
 * The driver also returns a custom define inside the IOCTL which can be:
 *
 * HL_WAIT_CS_STATUS_COMPLETED   - The CS has been completed successfully (0)
 * HL_WAIT_CS_STATUS_BUSY        - The CS is still executing (0)
 * HL_WAIT_CS_STATUS_TIMEDOUT    - The CS has caused a timeout on the device
 *                                 (ETIMEDOUT)
 * HL_WAIT_CS_STATUS_ABORTED     - The CS was aborted, usually because the
 *                                 device was reset (EIO)
 * HL_WAIT_CS_STATUS_INTERRUPTED - Waiting for the CS was interrupted (EINTR)

 * opened on the device, the driver won't allow any user to debug the device.
 *
 * For each configuration request, the user needs to provide the register index
 * and essential data such as buffer address and size.
 *
 * Once the user has finished using the debug/profile engines, he should
