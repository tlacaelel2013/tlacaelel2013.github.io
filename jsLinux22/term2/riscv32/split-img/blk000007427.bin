 *	dot11RSNAConfigPMKReauthThreshold; 0 is not a valid value).
 *	An optional parameter configured through %NL80211_CMD_SET_PMKSA.
 *	Drivers that trigger roaming need to know the lifetime of the
 *	configured PMKSA for triggering the full vs. PMKSA caching based
 *	authentication. This timeout helps authentication methods like SAE,
 *	where PMK gets updated only by going through a full (new SAE)
 *	authentication instead of getting updated during an association for EAP
 *	authentication. No new full authentication within the PMK expiry shall
 *	result in a disassociation at the end of the lifetime.
 *
 * @NL80211_ATTR_PMK_REAUTH_THRESHOLD: Reauthentication threshold time, in
 *	terms of percentage of %NL80211_ATTR_PMK_LIFETIME
 *	(u8, dot11RSNAConfigPMKReauthThreshold, 1..100). This is an optional
 *	parameter configured through %NL80211_CMD_SET_PMKSA. Requests the
 *	driver to trigger a full authentication roam (without PMKSA caching)
 *	after the reauthentication threshold time, but before the PMK lifetime
 *	has expired.
 *
 *	Authentication methods like SAE need to be able to generate a new PMKSA
 *	entry without having to force a disconnection after the PMK timeout. If
 *	no roaming occurs between the reauth threshold and PMK expiration,
 *	disassociation is still forced.
 * @NL80211_ATTR_RECEIVE_MULTICAST: multicast flag for the
 *	%NL80211_CMD_REGISTER_FRAME command, see the description there.
 * @NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ_OFFSET: offset of the associated
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ in positive KHz. Only valid when supplied with
 *	an %NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ_OFFSET.
 * @NL80211_ATTR_CENTER_FREQ1_OFFSET: Center frequency offset in KHz for the
 *	first channel segment specified in %NL80211_ATTR_CENTER_FREQ1.
 * @NL80211_ATTR_SCAN_FREQ_KHZ: nested attribute with KHz frequencies
 *
 * @NL80211_ATTR_HE_6GHZ_CAPABILITY: HE 6 GHz Band Capability eleme
