 the indicated BSS is not ideal. Only one
 *	set of BSSID,frequency parameters is used (i.e., either the enforcing
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_MAC,%NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ or the less strict
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_MAC_HINT and %NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ_HINT).
 *	Driver shall not modify the IEs specified through %NL80211_ATTR_IE if
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_MAC is included. However, if %NL80211_ATTR_MAC_HINT is
 *	included, these IEs through %NL80211_ATTR_IE are specified by the user
 *	space based on the best possible BSS selected. Thus, if the driver ends
 *	up selecting a different BSS, it can modify these IEs accordingly (e.g.
 *	userspace asks the driver to perform PMKSA caching with BSS1 and the
 *	driver ends up selecting BSS2 with different PMKSA cache entry; RSNIE
 *	has to get updated with the apt PMKID).
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_PREV_BSSID can be used to request a reassociation within
 *	the ESS in case the device is already associated and an association with
 *	a different BSS is desired.
 *	Background scan period can optionally be
 *	specified in %NL80211_ATTR_BG_SCAN_PERIOD,
 *	if not specified default background scan configuration
 *	in driver is used and if period value is 0, bg scan will be disabled.
 *	This attribute is ignored if driver does not support roam scan.
 *	It is also sent as an event, with the BSSID and response IEs when the
 *	connection is established or failed to be established. This can be
 *	determined by the %NL80211_ATTR_STATUS_CODE attribute (0 = success,
 *	non-zero = failure). If %NL80211_ATTR_TIMED_OUT is included in the
 *	event, the connection attempt failed due to not being able to initiate
 *	authentication/association or not receiving a response from the AP.
 *	Non-zero %NL80211_ATTR_STATUS_CODE value is indicated in that case as
 *	well to remain backwards compatible.
 *	When establishing a security association, drivers that support 4 way
 *	handshake offload should send %NL80211_CMD_PORT_AUTHORIZED event when
 *	the 4 way handshake is completed successfully.
 * @NL80211_CMD_ROAM: Notification indicating the card/driver roamed by itself.
 *	When a security association was established with the new AP (e.g. if
 *	the FT protocol was used for roaming or the driver completed the 4 way
 *	handshake), this event should be followed by an
 *	%NL80211_CMD_PORT_AUTHORIZED event.
 * @NL80211_CMD_DISCONNECT: drop a given connection; also used to notify
 *	userspace that a connection was dropped by the AP or due to other
 *	reasons, for this the %NL80211_ATTR_DISCONNECTED_BY_AP and
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_REASON_CODE attributes are used.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_WIPHY_NETNS: Set a wiphy's netns. Note that all devices
 *	associated with this wiphy must be down and will follow.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_REMAIN_ON_CHANNEL: Request to remain awake on the specified
 *	channel for the specified amount of time. This can be used to do
 *	off-channel operations like transmit a Public Action frame and wait for
 *	a response while being associated to an AP on another channel.
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX is used to specify which interface (and thus
 *	radio) is used. %NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ is used to specify the
 *	frequency for the operation.
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_DURATION is used to specify the duration in milliseconds
 *	to remain on the channel. This command is also used as an event to
 *	notify when the requested duration starts (it may take a while for the
 *	driver to schedule this time due to other concurrent needs for the
 *	radio).
 *	When called, this operation returns a cookie (%NL80211_ATTR_COOKIE)
 *	that will be included with any events pertaining to this request;
 *	the cookie is also used to cancel the request.
 * @NL80211_CMD_CANCEL_REMAIN_ON_CHANNEL: This command can be used to cancel a
 *	pending remain-on-channel duration if the desired operation has been
 *	completed prior to expiration of the originally requested duration.
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY or %NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX is used to specify the
 *	radio. The %NL80211_ATTR_COOKIE attribute must be given as well to
 *	uniquely identify the request.
 *	This command is also used as an event to notify when a requested
 *	remain-on-channel duration has expired.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_TX_BITRATE_MASK: Set the mask of rates to be used in TX
 *	rate selection. %NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX is used to specify the interface
 *	and @NL80211_ATTR_TX_RATES the set of allowed rates.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_REGISTER_FRAME: Register for receiving certain mgmt frames
 *	(via @NL80211_CMD_FRAME) for processing in userspace. This command
 *	requires an interface index, a frame type attribute (optional for
 *	backward compatibility reasons, if not given assumes action frames)
 *	and a match attribute containing the first few bytes of the frame
 *	that should match, e.g. a single byte for only a category match or
 *	four bytes for vendor frames including the OUI. The registration
 *	cannot be dropped, but is removed automatically when the netlink
 *	socket is closed. Multiple registrations can be made.
 *	The %NL80211_ATTR_RECEIVE_MULTICAST flag attribute can be given if
 *	%NL80211_EXT_FEATURE_MULTICAST_REGISTRATIONS is available, in which
 *	case the registration can also be modified to include/exclude the
 *	flag, rather than requiring unregistration to change it.
 * @NL80211_CMD_REGISTER_ACTION: Alias for @NL80211_CMD_REGISTER_FRAME for
 *	backward compatibility
 * @NL80211_CMD_FRAME: Management frame TX request and RX notification. This
 *	command is used both as a request to transmit a management frame and
 *	as an event indicating reception of a frame that was not processed in
 *	kernel code, but is for us (i.e., which may need to be processed in a
 *	user space application). %NL80211_ATTR_FRAME is used to specify the
 *	frame contents (including header). %NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ is used
 *	to indicate on which channel the frame is to be transmitted or was
 *	received. If this channel is not the current channel (remain-on-channel
 *	or the operational channel) the device will switch to the given channel
 *	and transmit the frame, optionally waiting for a response for the time
 *	specified using %NL80211_ATTR_DURATION. When called, this operation
 *	returns a cookie (%NL80211_ATTR_COOKIE) that will be included with the
 *	TX status event pertaining to the TX request.
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_TX_NO_CCK_RATE is used to decide whether to send the
 *	management frames at CCK rate or not in 2GHz band.
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_CSA_C_OFFSETS_TX is an array of offsets to CSA
 *	counters which will be updated to the current value. This attribute
 *	is used during CSA period.
 * @NL80211_CMD_FRAME_WAIT_CANCEL: When an off-channel TX was requested, this
 *	command may be used with the corresponding cookie to cancel the wait
 *	time if it is known that it is no longer necessary.  This command is
 *	also sent as an event whenever the driver has completed the off-channel
 *	wait time.
 * @NL80211_CMD_ACTION: Alias for @NL80211_CMD_FRAME for backward compatibility.
 * @NL80211_CMD_FRAME_TX_STATUS: Report TX status of a management frame
 *	transmitted with %NL80211_CMD_FRAME. %NL80211_ATTR_COOKIE identifies
 *	the TX command and %NL80211_ATTR_FRAME includes the contents of the
 *	frame. %NL80211_ATTR_ACK flag is included if the recipient acknowledged
 *	the frame.
 * @NL80211_CMD_ACTION_TX_STATUS: Alias for @NL80211_CMD_FRAME_TX_STATUS for
 *	backward compatibility.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_POWER_SAVE: Set powersave, using %NL80211_ATTR_PS_STATE
 * @NL80211_CMD_GET_POWER_SAVE: Get powersave status in %NL80211_ATTR_PS_STATE
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_CQM: Connection quality monitor configuration. This command
 *	is used to configure connection quality monitoring notification trigger
 *	levels.
 * @NL80211_CMD_NOTIFY_CQM: Connection quality monitor notification. This
 *	command is used as an event to indicate the that a trigger level was
 *	reached.
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_CHANNEL: Set the channel (using %NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ
 *	and the attributes determining channel width) the given interface
 *	(identifed by %NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX) shall operate on.
 *	In case multiple channels are supported by the device, the mechanism
 *	with which it switches channels is implementation-defined.
 *	When a monitor interface is given, it can only switch channel while
 *	no other interfaces are operating to avoid disturbing the operation
 *	of any other interfaces, and other interfaces will again take
 *	precedence when they are used.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_WDS_PEER: Set the MAC address of the peer on a WDS interface.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_MULTICAST_TO_UNICAST: Configure if this AP should perform
 *	multicast to unicast conversion. When enabled, all multicast packets
 *	with ethertype ARP, IPv4 or IPv6 (possibly within an 802.1Q header)
 *	will be sent out to each station once with the destination (multicast)
 *	MAC address replaced by the station's MAC address. Note that this may
 *	break certain expectations of the receiver, e.g. the ability to drop
 *	unicast IP packets encapsulated in multicast L2 frames, or the ability
 *	to not send destination unreachable messages in such cases.
 *	This can only be toggled per BSS. Configure this on an interface of
 *	type %NL80211_IFTYPE_AP. It applies to all its VLAN interfaces
 *	(%NL80211_IFTYPE_AP_VLAN), except for those in 4addr (WDS) mode.
 *	If %NL80211_ATTR_MULTICAST_TO_UNICAST_ENABLED is not present with this
 *	command, the feature is disabled.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_JOIN_MESH: Join a mesh. The mesh ID must be given, and initial
 *	mesh config parameters may be given.
 * @NL80211_CMD_LEAVE_MESH: Leave the mesh network -- no special arguments, the
 *	network is determined by the network interface.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_UNPROT_DEAUTHENTICATE: Unprotected deauthentication frame
 *	notification. This event is used to indicate that an unprotected
 *	deauthentication frame was dropped when MFP is in use.
 * @NL80211_CMD_UNPROT_DISASSOCIATE: Unprotected disassociation frame
 *	notification. This event is used to indicate that an unprotected
 *	disassociation frame was dropped when MFP is in use.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_NEW_PEER_CANDIDATE: Notification on the reception of a
 *      beacon or probe response from a compatible mesh peer.  This is only
 *      sent while no station information (sta_info) exists for the new peer
 *      candidate and when @NL80211_MESH_SETUP_USERSPACE_AUTH,
 *      @NL80211_MESH_SETUP_USERSPACE_AMPE, or
 *      @NL80211_MESH_SETUP_USERSPACE_MPM is set.  On reception of this
 *      notification, userspace may decide to create a new station
 *      (@NL80211_CMD_NEW_STATION).  To stop this notification from
 *      reoccurring, the userspace authentication daemon may want to create the
 *      new station with the AUTHENTICATED flag unset and maybe change it later
 *      depending on the authentication result.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_GET_WOWLAN: get Wake-on-Wireless-LAN (WoWLAN) settings.
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_WOWLAN: set Wake-on-Wireless-LAN (WoWLAN) settings.
 *	Since wireless is more complex than wired ethernet, it supports
 *	various triggers. These triggers can be configured through this
 *	command with the %NL80211_ATTR_WOWLAN_TRIGGERS attribute. For
 *	more background information, see
 *	https://wireless.wiki.kernel.org/en/users/Documentation/WoWLAN.
 *	The @NL80211_CMD_SET_WOWLAN command can also be used as a notification
 *	from the driver reporting the wakeup reason. In this case, the
 *	@NL80211_ATTR_WOWLAN_TRIGGERS attribute will contain the reason
 *	for the wakeup, if it was caused by wireless. If it is not present
 *	in the wakeup notification, the wireless device didn't cause the
 *	wakeup but reports that it was woken up.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_REKEY_OFFLOAD: This command is used give the driver
 *	the necessary information for supporting GTK rekey offload. This
 *	feature is typically used during WoWLAN. The configuration data
 *	is contained in %NL80211_ATTR_REKEY_DATA (which is nested and
 *	contains the data in sub-attributes). After rekeying happened,
 *	this command may also be sent by the driver as an MLME event to
 *	inform userspace of the new replay counter.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_PMKSA_CANDIDATE: This is used as an event to inform userspace
 *	of PMKSA caching dandidates.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_TDLS_OPER: Perform a high-level TDLS command (e.g. link setup).
 *	In addition, this can be used as an event to request userspace to take
 *	actions on TDLS links (set up a new link or tear down an existing one).
 *	In such events, %NL80211_ATTR_TDLS_OPERATION indicates the requested
 *	operation, %NL80211_ATTR_MAC contains the peer MAC address, and
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_REASON_CODE the reason code to be used (only with
 *	%NL80211_TDLS_TEARDOWN).
 * @NL80211_CMD_TDLS_MGMT: Send a TDLS management frame. The
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_TDLS_ACTION attribute determines the type of frame to be
 *	sent. Public Action codes (802.11-2012 8.1.5.1) will be sent as
 *	802.11 management frames, while TDLS action codes (802.11-2012
 *	8.5.13.1) will be encapsulated and sent as data frames. The currently
 *	supported Public Action code is %WLAN_PUB_ACTION_TDLS_DISCOVER_RES
 *	and the currently supported TDLS actions codes are given in
 *	&enum ieee80211_tdls_actioncode.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_UNEXPECTED_FRAME: Used by an application controlling an AP
 *	(or GO) interface (i.e. hostapd) to ask for unexpected frames to
 *	implement sending deauth to stations that send unexpected class 3
 *	frames. Also used as the event sent by the kernel when such a frame
 *	is received.
 *	For the event, the %NL80211_ATTR_MAC attribute carries the TA and
 *	other attributes like the interface index are present.
 *	If used as the command it must have an interface index and you can
 *	only unsubscribe from the event by closing the socket. Subscription
 *	is also for %NL80211_CMD_UNEXPECTED_4ADDR_FRAME events.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_UNEXPECTED_4ADDR_FRAME: Sent as an event indicating that the
 *	associated station identified by %NL80211_ATTR_MAC sent a 4addr frame
 *	and wasn't already in a 4-addr VLAN. The event will be sent similarly
 *	to the %NL80211_CMD_UNEXPECTED_FRAME event, to the same listener.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_PROBE_CLIENT: Probe an associated station on an AP interface
 *	by sending a null data frame to it and reporting when the frame is
 *	acknowleged. This is used to allow timing out inactive clients. Uses
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX and %NL80211_ATTR_MAC. The command returns a
 *	direct reply with an %NL80211_ATTR_COOKIE that is later used to match
 *	up the event with the request. The event includes the same data and
 *	has %NL80211_ATTR_ACK set if the frame was ACKed.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_REGISTER_BEACONS: Register this socket to receive beacons from
 *	other BSSes when any interfaces are in AP mode. This helps implement
 *	OLBC handling in hostapd. Beacons are reported in %NL80211_CMD_FRAME
 *	messages. Note that per PHY only one application may register.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_NOACK_MAP: sets a bitmap for the individual TIDs whether
 *      No Acknowledgement Policy should be applied.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_CH_SWITCH_NOTIFY: An AP or GO may decide to switch channels
 *	independently of the userspace SME, send this event indicating
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX is now on %NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ and the
 *	attributes determining channel width.  This indication may also be
 *	sent when a remotely-initiated switch (e.g., when a STA receives a CSA
 *	from the remote AP) is completed;
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_CH_SWITCH_STARTED_NOTIFY: Notify that a channel switch
 *	has been started on an interface, regardless of the initiator
 *	(ie. whether it was requested from a remote device or
 *	initiated on our own).  It indicates that
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX will be on %NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ
 *	after %NL80211_ATTR_CH_SWITCH_COUNT TBTT's.  The userspace may
 *	decide to react to this indication by requesting other
 *	interfaces to change channel as well.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_START_P2P_DEVICE: Start the given P2P Device, identified by
 *	its %NL80211_ATTR_WDEV identifier. It must have been created with
 *	%NL80211_CMD_NEW_INTERFACE previously. After it has been started, the
 *	P2P Device can be used for P2P operations, e.g. remain-on-channel and
 *	public action frame TX.
 * @NL80211_CMD_STOP_P2P_DEVICE: Stop the given P2P Device, identified by

 *	notify userspace that AP has rejected the connection request from a
 *	station, due to particular reason. %NL80211_ATTR_CONN_FAILED_REASON
 *	is used for this.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_MCAST_RATE: Change the rate used to send multicast frames
 *	for IBSS or MESH vif.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_MAC_ACL: sets ACL for MAC address based access control.
 *	This is to be used with the drivers advertising the support of MAC
 *	address based access control. List of MAC addresses is passed in
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_MAC_ADDRS and ACL policy is passed in
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_ACL_POLICY. Driver will enable ACL with this list, if it
 *	is not already done. The new list will replace any existing list. Driver
 *	will clear its ACL when the list of MAC addresses passed is empty. This
 *	command is used in AP/P2P GO mode. Driver has to make sure to clear its
 *	ACL list during %NL80211_CMD_STOP_AP.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_RADAR_DETECT: Start a Channel availability check (CAC). Once
 *	a radar is detected or the channel availability scan (CAC) has finished
 *	or was aborted, or a radar was detected, usermode will be notified with
 *	this event. This command is also used to notify userspace about radars
 *	while operating on this channel.
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_RADAR_EVENT is used to inform about the type of the
 *	event.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_GET_PROTOCOL_FEATURES: Get global nl80211 protocol features,
 *	i.e. features for the nl80211 protocol rather than device features.
 *	Returns the features in the %NL80211_ATTR_PROTOCOL_FEATURES bitmap.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_UPDATE_FT_IES: Pass down the most up-to-date Fast Transition
 *	Information Element to the WLAN driver
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_FT_EVENT: Send a Fast transition event from the WLAN driver
 *	to the supplicant. This will carry the target AP's MAC address along
 *	with the relevant Information Elements. This event is used to report
 *	received FT IEs (MDIE, FTIE, RSN IE, TIE, RICIE).
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_CRIT_PROTOCOL_START: Indicates user-space will start running
 *	a critical protocol that needs more reliability in the connection to
 *	complete.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_CRIT_PROTOCOL_STOP: Indicates the connection reliability can
 *	return back to normal.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_GET_COALESCE: Get currently supported coalesce rules.
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_COALESCE: Configure coalesce rules or clear existing rules.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_CHANNEL_SWITCH: Perform a channel switch by announcing the
 *	the new channel information (Channel Switch Announcement - CSA)
 *	in the beacon for some time (as defined in the
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_CH_SWITCH_COUNT parameter) and then change to the
 *	new channel. Userspace provides the new channel information (using
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ and the attributes determining channel
 *	width). %NL80211_ATTR_CH_SWITCH_BLOCK_TX may be supplied to inform
 *	other station that transmission must be blocked until the channel
 *	switch is complete.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_VENDOR: Vendor-specified command/event. The command is specified
 *	by the %NL80211_ATTR_VENDOR_ID attribute and a sub-command in
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_VENDOR_SUBCMD. Parameter(s) can be transported in
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_VENDOR_DATA.
 *	For feature advertisement, the %NL80211_ATTR_VENDOR_DATA attribute is
 *	used in the wiphy data as a nested attribute containing descriptions
 *	(&struct nl80211_vendor_cmd_info) of the supported vendor commands.
 *	This may also be sent as an event with the same attributes.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_QOS_MAP: Set Interworking QoS mapping for IP DSCP values.
 *	The QoS mapping information is included in %NL80211_ATTR_QOS_MAP. If
 *	that attribute is not included, QoS mapping is disabled. Since this
 *	QoS mapping is relevant for IP packets, it is only valid during an
 *	association. This is cleared on disassociation and AP restart.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_ADD_TX_TS: Ask the kernel to add a traffic stream for the given
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_TSID and %NL80211_ATTR_MAC with %NL80211_ATTR_USER_PRIO
 *	and %NL80211_ATTR_ADMITTED_TIME parameters.
 *	Note that the action frame handshake with the AP shall be handled by
 *	userspace via the normal management RX/TX framework, this only sets
 *	up the TX TS in the driver/device.
 *	If the admitted time attribute is not added then the request just checks
 *	if a subsequent setup could be successful, the intent is to use this to
 *	avoid setting up a session with the AP when local restrictions would
 *	make that impossible. However, the subsequent "real" setup may still
 *	fail even if the check was successful.
 * @NL80211_CMD_DEL_TX_TS: Remove an existing TS with the %NL80211_ATTR_TSID
 *	and %NL80211_ATTR_MAC parameters. It isn't necessary to call this
 *	before removing a station entry entirely, or before disassociating
 *	or similar, cleanup will happen in the driver/device in this case.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_GET_MPP: Get mesh path attributes for mesh proxy path to
 *	destination %NL80211_ATTR_MAC on the interface identified by
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_IFINDEX.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_JOIN_OCB: Join the OCB network. The center frequency and
 *	bandwidth of a channel must be given.
 * @NL80211_CMD_LEAVE_OCB: Leave the OCB network -- no special arguments, the
 *	network is determined by the network interface.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_TDLS_CHANNEL_SWITCH: Start channel-switching with a TDLS peer,
 *	identified by the %NL80211_ATTR_MAC parameter. A target channel is
 *	provided via %NL80211_ATTR_WIPHY_FREQ and other attributes determining
 *	channel width/type. The target operating class is given via
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_OPER_CLASS.
 *	The driver is responsible for continually initiating channel-switching
 *	operations and returning to the base channel for communication with the
 *	AP.
 * @NL80211_CMD_TDLS_CANCEL_CHANNEL_SWITCH: Stop channel-switching with a TDLS
 *	peer given by %NL80211_ATTR_MAC. Both peers must be on the base channel
 *	when this command completes.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_WIPHY_REG_CHANGE: Similar to %NL80211_CMD_REG_CHANGE, but used
 *	as an event to indicate changes for devices with wiphy-specific regdom
 *	management.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_ABORT_SCAN: Stop an ongoing scan. Returns -ENOENT if a scan is
 *	not running. The driver indicates the status of the scan through
 *	cfg80211_scan_done().
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_START_NAN: Start NAN operation, identified by its
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_WDEV interface. This interface must have been
 *	previously created with %NL80211_CMD_NEW_INTERFACE. After it
 *	has been started, the NAN interface will create or join a
 *	cluster. This command must have a valid
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_NAN_MASTER_PREF attribute and optional
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_BANDS attributes.  If %NL80211_ATTR_BANDS is
 *	omitted or set to 0, it means don't-care and the device will
 *	decide what to use.  After this command NAN functions can be
 *	added.
 * @NL80211_CMD_STOP_NAN: Stop the NAN operation, identified by
 *	its %NL80211_ATTR_WDEV interface.
 * @NL80211_CMD_ADD_NAN_FUNCTION: Add a NAN function. The function is defined
 *	with %NL80211_ATTR_NAN_FUNC nested attribute. When called, this
 *	operation returns the strictly positive and unique instance id
 *	(%NL80211_ATTR_NAN_FUNC_INST_ID) and a cookie (%NL80211_ATTR_COOKIE)
 *	of the function upon success.
 *	Since instance ID's can be re-used, this cookie is the right
 *	way to identify the function. This will avoid races when a termination
 *	event is handled by the user space after it has already added a new
 *	function that got the same instance id from the kernel as the one
 *	which just terminated.
 *	This cookie may be used in NAN events even before the command
 *	returns, so userspace shouldn't process NAN events until it processes
 *	the response to this command.
 *	Look at %NL80211_ATTR_SOCKET_OWNER as well.
 * @NL80211_CMD_DEL_NAN_FUNCTION: Delete a NAN function by cookie.
 *	This command is also used as a notification sent when a NAN function is
 *	terminated. This will contain a %NL80211_ATTR_NAN_FUNC_INST_ID
 *	and %NL80211_ATTR_COOKIE attributes.
 * @NL80211_CMD_CHANGE_NAN_CONFIG: Change current NAN
 *	configuration. NAN must be operational (%NL80211_CMD_START_NAN
 *	was executed).  It must contain at least one of the following
 *	attributes: %NL80211_ATTR_NAN_MASTER_PREF,
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_BANDS.  If %NL80211_ATTR_BANDS is omitted, the
 *	current configuration is not changed.  If it is present but
 *	set to zero, the configuration is changed to don't-care
 *	(i.e. the device can decide what to do).
 * @NL80211_CMD_NAN_FUNC_MATCH: Notification sent when a match is reported.
 *	This will contain a %NL80211_ATTR_NAN_MATCH nested attribute and
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_COOKIE.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_UPDATE_CONNECT_PARAMS: Update one or more connect parameters
 *	for subsequent roaming cases if the driver or firmware uses internal
 *	BSS selection. This command can be issued only while connected and it
 *	does not result in a change for the current association. Currently,
 *	only the %NL80211_ATTR_IE data is used and updated with this command.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_SET_PMK: For offloaded 4-Way handshake, set the PMK or PMK-R0
 *	for the given authenticator address (specified with %NL80211_ATTR_MAC).
 *	When %NL80211_ATTR_PMKR0_NAME is set, %NL80211_ATTR_PMK specifies the
 *	PMK-R0, otherwise it specifies the PMK.
 * @NL80211_CMD_DEL_PMK: For offloaded 4-Way handshake, delete the previously
 *	configured PMK for the authenticator address identified by
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_MAC.
 * @NL80211_CMD_PORT_AUTHORIZED: An event that indicates that the 4 way
 *	handshake was completed successfully by the driver. The BSSID is
 *	specified with %NL80211_ATTR_MAC. Drivers that support 4 way handshake
 *	offload should send this event after indicating 802.11 association with
 *	%NL80211_CMD_CONNECT or %NL80211_CMD_ROAM. If the 4 way handshake failed
 *	%NL80211_CMD_DISCONNECT should be indicated instead.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_CONTROL_PORT_FRAME: Control Port (e.g. PAE) frame TX request
 *	and RX notification.  This command is used both as a request to transmit
 *	a control port frame and as a notification that a control port frame
 *	has been received. %NL80211_ATTR_FRAME is used to specify the
 *	frame contents.  The frame is the raw EAPoL data, without ethernet or
 *	802.11 headers.
 *	When used as an event indication %NL80211_ATTR_CONTROL_PORT_ETHERTYPE,
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_CONTROL_PORT_NO_ENCRYPT and %NL80211_ATTR_MAC are added
 *	indicating the protocol type of the received frame; whether the frame
 *	was received unencrypted and the MAC address of the peer respectively.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_RELOAD_REGDB: Request that the regdb firmware file is reloaded.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_EXTERNAL_AUTH: This interface is exclusively defined for host
 *	drivers that do not define separate commands for authentication and
 *	association, but rely on user space for the authentication to happen.
 *	This interface acts both as the event request (driver to user space)
 *	to trigger the authentication and command response (userspace to
 *	driver) to indicate the authentication status.
 *
 *	User space uses the %NL80211_CMD_CONNECT command to the host driver to
 *	trigger a connection. The host driver selects a BSS and further uses
 *	this interface to offload only the authentication part to the user
 *	space. Authentication frames are passed between the driver and user
 *	space through the %NL80211_CMD_FRAME interface. Host driver proceeds
 *	further with the association after getting successful authentication
 *	status. User space indicates the authentication status through
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_STATUS_CODE attribute in %NL80211_CMD_EXTERNAL_AUTH
 *	command interface.
 *
 *	Host driver reports this status on an authentication failure to the
 *	user space through the connect result as the user space would have
 *	initiated the connection through the connect request.
 *
 * @NL80211_CMD_STA_OPMODE_CHANGED: An event that notify station's
 *	ht opmode or vht opmode changes using any of %NL80211_ATTR_SMPS_MODE,
 *	%NL80211_ATTR_CHANNEL_WIDTH,%NL80211_ATTR_NSS attributes with its
 *	address(specified in %NL80211_ATTR_MAC).
