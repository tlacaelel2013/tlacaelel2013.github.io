  The data format used by the zlib library is described by RFCs (Request for

/*
    The 'zlib' compression library provides in-memory compression and
  decompression functions, including integrity checks of the uncompressed data.
  This version of the library supports only one compression method (deflation)
  but other algorithms will be added later and will have the same stream
  interface.

    Compression can be done in a single step if the buffers are large enough,
  or can be done by repeated calls of the compression function.  In the latter
  case, the application must provide more input and/or consume the output
  (providing more output space) before each call.

    The compressed data format used by default by the in-memory functions is
  the zlib format, which is a zlib wrapper documented in RFC 1950, wrapped
  around a deflate stream, which is itself documented in RFC 1951.

    The library also supports reading and writing files in gzip (.gz) format
  with an interface similar to that of stdio using the functions that start
  with "gz".  The gzip format is different from the zlib format.  gzip is a
  gzip wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

    This library can optionally read and write gzip and raw deflate streams in
  memory as well.

    The zlib format was designed to be compact and fast for use in memory
  and on communications channels.  The gzip format was designed for single-
  file compression on file systems, has a larger header than zlib to maintain
  directory information, and uses a different, slower check method than zlib.

    The library does not install any signal handler.  The decoder checks
  the consistency of the compressed data, so the library should never crash
  even in the case of corrupted input.

   the library with -DMAX_WBITS=14 (see zconf.h).

     The fields total_in and total_out can be used for statistics or progress
   reports.  After compression, total_in holds the total size of the
   uncompressed data and may be saved for use by the decompressor (particularly
   if the decompressor wants to decompress everything in a single step).

int deflate(z_streamp strm, int flush);
/*
    deflate compresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.  It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

    The detailed semantics are as follows.  deflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Compress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly.  If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), next_in and avail_in are updated and
    processing will resume at this point for the next call of deflate().

  - Generate more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  This action is forced if the parameter flush is non zero.
    Forcing flush frequently degrades the compression ratio, so this parameter
    should be set only when necessary.  Some output may be provided even if
    flush is zero.

    Before the call of deflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more
  output, and updating avail_in or avail_out accordingly; avail_out should
  never be zero before the call.  The application can consume the compressed
  output when it wants, for example when the output buffer is full (avail_out
  == 0), or after each call of deflate().  If deflate returns Z_OK and with
  zero avail_out, it must be called again after making room in the output
  buffer because there might be more output pending. See deflatePending(),
  which can be used if desired to determine whether or not there is more ouput
  in that case.

    Normally the parameter flush is set to Z_NO_FLUSH, which allows deflate to
  decide how much data to accumulate before producing output, in order to
  maximize compression.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_SYNC_FLUSH, all pending output is
  flushed to the output buffer and the output is aligned on a byte boundary, so
  that the decompressor can get all input data available so far.  (In
  particular avail_in is zero after the call if enough output space has been
  provided before the call.) Flushing may degrade compression for some
  compression algorithms and so it should be used only when necessary.  This
  completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty stored block
  that is three bits plus filler bits to the next byte, followed by four bytes
  (00 00 ff ff).

    If flush is set to Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, all pending output is flushed to the
  output buffer, but the output is not aligned to a byte boundary.  All of the
  input data so far will be available to the decompressor, as for Z_SYNC_FLUSH.
  This completes the current deflate block and follows it with an empty fixed
  codes block that is 10 bits long.  This assures that enough bytes are output
  in order for the decompressor to finish the block before the empty fixed
  codes block.

    If flush is set to Z_BLOCK, a deflate block is completed and emitted, as
  for Z_SYNC_FLUSH, but the output is not aligned on a byte boundary, and up to
  seven bits of the current block are held to be written as the next byte after
  the next deflate block is completed.  In this case, the decompressor may not
  be provided enough bits at this point in order to complete decompression of
  the data provided so far to the compressor.  It may need to wait for the next
  block to be emitted.  This is for advanced applications that need to control
  the emission of deflate blocks.

    If flush is set to Z_FULL_FLUSH, all output is flushed as with
  Z_SYNC_FLUSH, and the compression state is reset so that decompression can
  restart from this point if previous compressed data has been damaged or if
  random access is desired.  Using Z_FULL_FLUSH too often can seriously degrade
  compression.

    If deflate returns with avail_out == 0, this function must be called again
  with the same value of the flush parameter and more output space (updated
  avail_out), until the flush is complete (deflate returns with non-zero
  avail_out).  In the case of a Z_FULL_FLUSH or Z_SYNC_FLUSH, make sure that
  avail_out is greater than six to avoid repeated flush markers due to
  avail_out == 0 on return.

    If the parameter flush is set to Z_FINISH, pending input is processed,
  pending output is flushed and deflate returns with Z_STREAM_END if there was
  enough output space.  If deflate returns with Z_OK or Z_BUF_ERROR, this
  function must be called again with Z_FINISH and more output space (updated
  avail_out) but no more input data, until it returns with Z_STREAM_END or an
  error.  After deflate has returned Z_STREAM_END, the only possible operations
  on the stream are deflateReset or deflateEnd.

    Z_FINISH can be used in the first deflate call after deflateInit if all the
  compression is to be done in a single step.  In order to complete in one
  call, avail_out must be at least the value returned by deflateBound (see
  below).  Then deflate is guaranteed to return Z_STREAM_END.  If not enough
  output space is provided, deflate will not return Z_STREAM_END, and it must
  be called again as described above.

    deflate() sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all input read
  so far (that is, total_in bytes).  If a gzip stream is being generated, then
  strm->adler will be the CRC-32 checksum of the input read so far.  (See
  deflateInit2 below.)

    deflate() may update strm->data_type if it can make a good guess about
  the input data type (Z_BINARY or Z_TEXT).  If in doubt, the data is
  considered binary.  This field is only for information purposes and does not
  affect the compression algorithm in any manner.

    deflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input
  processed or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if all input has been
  consumed and all output has been produced (only when flush is set to
  Z_FINISH), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream state was inconsistent (for example
  if next_in or next_out was Z_NULL or the state was inadvertently written over
  by the application), or Z_BUF_ERROR if no progress is possible (for example
  avail_in or avail_out was zero).  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  deflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue compressing.

int deflateEnd(z_streamp strm);

     deflateEnd returns Z_OK if success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the

   the first call of inflate (if the decompression does not complete on the

int inflate(z_streamp strm, int flush);
/*
    inflate decompresses as much data as possible, and stops when the input
  buffer becomes empty or the output buffer becomes full.  It may introduce
  some output latency (reading input without producing any output) except when
  forced to flush.

  The detailed semantics are as follows.  inflate performs one or both of the
  following actions:

  - Decompress more input starting at next_in and update next_in and avail_in
    accordingly.  If not all input can be processed (because there is not
    enough room in the output buffer), then next_in and avail_in are updated
    accordingly, and processing will resume at this point for the next call of
    inflate().

  - Generate more output starting at next_out and update next_out and avail_out
    accordingly.  inflate() provides as much output as possible, until there is
    no more input data or no more space in the output buffer (see below about
    the flush parameter).

    Before the call of inflate(), the application should ensure that at least
  one of the actions is possible, by providing more input and/or consuming more
  output, and updating the next_* and avail_* values accordingly.  If the
  caller of inflate() does not provide both available input and available
  output space, it is possible that there will be no progress made.  The
  application can consume the uncompressed output when it wants, for example
  when the output buffer is full (avail_out == 0), or after each call of
  inflate().  If inflate returns Z_OK and with zero avail_out, it must be
  called again after making room in the output buffer because there might be
  more output pending.

    The flush parameter of inflate() can be Z_NO_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, Z_FINISH,
  Z_BLOCK, or Z_TREES.  Z_SYNC_FLUSH requests that inflate() flush as much
  output as possible to the output buffer.  Z_BLOCK requests that inflate()
  stop if and when it gets to the next deflate block boundary.  When decoding
  the zlib or gzip format, this will cause inflate() to return immediately
  after the header and before the first block.  When doing a raw inflate,
  inflate() will go ahead and process the first block, and will return when it
  gets to the end of that block, or when it runs out of data.

    The Z_BLOCK option assists in appending to or combining deflate streams.
  To assist in this, on return inflate() always sets strm->data_type to the
  number of unused bits in the last byte taken from strm->next_in, plus 64 if
  inflate() is currently decoding the last block in the deflate stream, plus
  128 if inflate() returned immediately after decoding an end-of-block code or
  decoding the complete header up to just before the first byte of the deflate
  stream.  The end-of-block will not be indicated until all of the uncompressed
  data from that block has been written to strm->next_out.  The number of
  unused bits may in general be greater than seven, except when bit 7 of
  data_type is set, in which case the number of unused bits will be less than
  eight.  data_type is set as noted here every time inflate() returns for all
  flush options, and so can be used to determine the amount of currently
  consumed input in bits.

    The Z_TREES option behaves as Z_BLOCK does, but it also returns when the
  end of each deflate block header is reached, before any actual data in that
  block is decoded.  This allows the caller to determine the length of the
  deflate block header for later use in random access within a deflate block.
  256 is added to the value of strm->data_type when inflate() returns
  immediately after reaching the end of the deflate block header.

    inflate() should normally be called until it returns Z_STREAM_END or an
  error.  However if all decompression is to be performed in a single step (a
  single call of inflate), the parameter flush should be set to Z_FINISH.  In
  this case all pending input is processed and all pending output is flushed;
  avail_out must be large enough to hold all of the uncompressed data for the
  operation to complete.  (The size of the uncompressed data may have been
  saved by the compressor for this purpose.)  The use of Z_FINISH is not
  required to perform an inflation in one step.  However it may be used to
  inform inflate that a faster approach can be used for the single inflate()
  call.  Z_FINISH also informs inflate to not maintain a sliding window if the
  stream completes, which reduces inflate's memory footprint.  If the stream
  does not complete, either because not all of the stream is provided or not
  enough output space is provided, then a sliding window will be allocated and
  inflate() can be called again to continue the operation as if Z_NO_FLUSH had
  been used.

     In this implementation, inflate() always flushes as much output as
  possible to the output buffer, and always uses the faster approach on the
  first call.  So the effects of the flush parameter in this implementation are
  on the return value of inflate() as noted below, when inflate() returns early
  when Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES is used, and when inflate() avoids the allocation of
  memory for a sliding window when Z_FINISH is used.

     If a preset dictionary is needed after this call (see inflateSetDictionary
  below), inflate sets strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of the dictionary
  chosen by the compressor and returns Z_NEED_DICT; otherwise it sets
  strm->adler to the Adler-32 checksum of all output produced so far (that is,
  total_out bytes) and returns Z_OK, Z_STREAM_END or an error code as described
  below.  At the end of the stream, inflate() checks that its computed Adler-32
  checksum is equal to that saved by the compressor and returns Z_STREAM_END
  only if the checksum is correct.

    inflate() can decompress and check either zlib-wrapped or gzip-wrapped
  deflate data.  The header type is detected automatically, if requested when
  initializing with inflateInit2().  Any information contained in the gzip
  header is not retained unless inflateGetHeader() is used.  When processing
  gzip-wrapped deflate data, strm->adler32 is set to the CRC-32 of the output
  produced so far.  The CRC-32 is checked against the gzip trailer, as is the
  uncompressed length, modulo 2^32.

    inflate() returns Z_OK if some progress has been made (more input processed
  or more output produced), Z_STREAM_END if the end of the compressed data has
  been reached and all uncompressed output has been produced, Z_NEED_DICT if a
  preset dictionary is needed at this point, Z_DATA_ERROR if the input data was
  corrupted (input stream not conforming to the zlib format or incorrect check
  value, in which case strm->msg points to a string with a more specific
  error), Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream structure was inconsistent (for example
  next_in or next_out was Z_NULL, or the state was inadvertently written over
  by the application), Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough memory, Z_BUF_ERROR
  if no progress was possible or if there was not enough room in the output
  buffer when Z_FINISH is used.  Note that Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, and
  inflate() can be called again with more input and more output space to
  continue decompressing.  If Z_DATA_ERROR is returned, the application may
  then call inflateSync() to look for a good compression block if a partial
  recovery of the data is to be attempted.

/*
     This is another version of deflateInit with more compression options.  The
   fields next_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized before by the
   caller.

     The method parameter is the compression method.  It must be Z_DEFLATED in
   this version of the library.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the window size
   (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8 .. 15 for this
   version of the library.  Larger values of this parameter result in better
   compression at the expense of memory usage.  The default value is 15 if
   deflateInit is used instead.

     For the current implementation of deflate(), a windowBits value of 8 (a
   window size of 256 bytes) is not supported.  As a result, a request for 8
   will result in 9 (a 512-byte window).  In that case, providing 8 to
   inflateInit2() will result in an error when the zlib header with 9 is
   checked against the initialization of inflate().  The remedy is to not use 8
   with deflateInit2() with this initialization, or at least in that case use 9
   with inflateInit2().

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw deflate.  In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size.  deflate() will then generate raw deflate data
   with no zlib header or trailer, and will not compute a check value.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip encoding.  Add
   16 to windowBits to write a simple gzip header and trailer around the
   compressed data instead of a zlib wrapper.  The gzip header will have no
   file name, no extra data, no comment, no modification time (set to zero), no
   header crc, and the operating system will be set to the appropriate value,
   if the operating system was determined at compile time.  If a gzip stream is
   being written, strm->adler is a CRC-32 instead of an Adler-32.

     For raw deflate or gzip encoding, a request for a 256-byte window is
   rejected as invalid, since only the zlib header provides a means of
   transmitting the window size to the decompressor.

     The memLevel parameter specifies how much memory should be allocated
   for the internal compression state.  memLevel=1 uses minimum memory but is
   slow and reduces compression ratio; memLevel=9 uses maximum memory for
   optimal speed.  The default value is 8.  See zconf.h for total memory usage
   as a function of windowBits and memLevel.

     The strategy parameter is used to tune the compression algorithm.  Use the
   value Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY for normal data, Z_FILTERED for data produced by a
   filter (or predictor), Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY to force Huffman encoding only (no
   string match), or Z_RLE to limit match distances to one (run-length
   encoding).  Filtered data consists mostly of small values with a somewhat
   random distribution.  In this case, the compression algorithm is tuned to
   compress them better.  The effect of Z_FILTERED is to force more Huffman
   coding and less string matching; it is somewhat intermediate between
   Z_DEFAULT_STRATEGY and Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY.  Z_RLE is designed to be almost as
   fast as Z_HUFFMAN_ONLY, but give better compression for PNG image data.  The
   strategy parameter only affects the compression ratio but not the
   correctness of the compressed output even if it is not set appropriately.
   Z_FIXED prevents the use of dynamic Huffman codes, allowing for a simpler
   decoder for special applications.

     deflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_STREAM_ERROR if any parameter is invalid (such as an invalid
   method), or Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version (zlib_version) is
   incompatible with the version assumed by the caller (ZLIB_VERSION).  msg is
   set to null if there is no error message.  deflateInit2 does not perform any
   compression: this will be done by deflate().

int deflateSetDictionary(z_streamp strm, const(ubyte)* dictionary, uint  dictLength);
/*
     Initializes the compression dictionary from the given byte sequence
   without producing any compressed output.  When using the zlib format, this
   function must be called immediately after deflateInit, deflateInit2 or
   deflateReset, and before any call of deflate.  When doing raw deflate, this
   function must be called either before any call of deflate, or immediately
   after the completion of a deflate block, i.e. after all input has been
   consumed and all output has been delivered when using any of the flush
   options Z_BLOCK, Z_PARTIAL_FLUSH, Z_SYNC_FLUSH, or Z_FULL_FLUSH.  The
   compressor and decompressor must use exactly the same dictionary (see
   inflateSetDictionary).

     The dictionary should consist of strings (byte sequences) that are likely
   to be encountered later in the data to be compressed, with the most commonly
   used strings preferably put towards the end of the dictionary.  Using a
   dictionary is most useful when the data to be compressed is short and can be
   predicted with good accuracy; the data can then be compressed better than
   with the default empty dictionary.

     Depending on the size of the compression data structures selected by
   deflateInit or deflateInit2, a part of the dictionary may in effect be
   discarded, for example if the dictionary is larger than the window size
   provided in deflateInit or deflateInit2.  Thus the strings most likely to be
   useful should be put at the end of the dictionary, not at the front.  In
   addition, the current implementation of deflate will use at most the window
   size minus 262 bytes of the provided dictionary.

     Upon return of this function, strm->adler is set to the Adler-32 value
   of the dictionary; the decompressor may later use this value to determine
   which dictionary has been used by the compressor.  (The Adler-32 value
   applies to the whole dictionary even if only a subset of the dictionary is
   actually used by the compressor.) If a raw deflate was requested, then the
   Adler-32 value is not computed and strm->adler is not set.

     deflateSetDictionary returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if a
   parameter is invalid (e.g.  dictionary being Z_NULL) or the stream state is
   inconsistent (for example if deflate has already been called for this stream
   or if not at a block boundary for raw deflate).  deflateSetDictionary does
   not perform any compression: this will be done by deflate().

     deflateGetDictionary() may return a length less than the window size, even

   to 258 bytes less in that case, due to how zlib's implementation of deflate
   manages the sliding window and lookahead for matches, where matches can be
   up to 258 bytes long. If the application needs the last window-size bytes of

   If the compression approach (which is a function of the level) or the
   strategy is changed, and if any input has been consumed in a previous
   deflate() call, then the input available so far is compressed with the old
   level and strategy using deflate(strm, Z_BLOCK).  There are three approaches
   for the compression levels 0, 1 .. 3, and 4 .. 9 respectively.  The new level
   and strategy will take effect at the next call of deflate().

     If a deflate(strm, Z_BLOCK) is performed by deflateParams(), and it does
   not have enough output space to complete, then the parameter change will not
   take effect.  In this case, deflateParams() can be called again with the
   same parameters and more output space to try again.

     In order to assure a change in the parameters on the first try, the
   deflate stream should be flushed using deflate() with Z_BLOCK or other flush
   request until strm.avail_out is not zero, before calling deflateParams().
   Then no more input data should be provided before the deflateParams() call.
   If this is done, the old level and strategy will be applied to the data
   compressed before deflateParams(), and the new level and strategy will be
   applied to the the data compressed after deflateParams().

     deflateParams returns Z_OK on success, Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source stream
   state was inconsistent or if a parameter was invalid, or Z_BUF_ERROR if
   there was not enough output space to complete the compression of the
   available input data before a change in the strategy or approach.  Note that
   in the case of a Z_BUF_ERROR, the parameters are not changed.  A return
   value of Z_BUF_ERROR is not fatal, in which case deflateParams() can be

   a zero byte, and that if extra is not Z_NULL, that extra_len bytes are

int inflateInit2(z_streamp strm, int windowBits)

}
/*
     This is another version of inflateInit with an extra parameter.  The
   fields next_in, avail_in, zalloc, zfree and opaque must be initialized
   before by the caller.

     The windowBits parameter is the base two logarithm of the maximum window
   size (the size of the history buffer).  It should be in the range 8 .. 15 for
   this version of the library.  The default value is 15 if inflateInit is used
   instead.  windowBits must be greater than or equal to the windowBits value
   provided to deflateInit2() while compressing, or it must be equal to 15 if
   deflateInit2() was not used.  If a compressed stream with a larger window
   size is given as input, inflate() will return with the error code
   Z_DATA_ERROR instead of trying to allocate a larger window.

     windowBits can also be zero to request that inflate use the window size in
   the zlib header of the compressed stream.

     windowBits can also be -8..-15 for raw inflate.  In this case, -windowBits
   determines the window size.  inflate() will then process raw deflate data,
   not looking for a zlib or gzip header, not generating a check value, and not
   looking for any check values for comparison at the end of the stream.  This
   is for use with other formats that use the deflate compressed data format
   such as zip.  Those formats provide their own check values.  If a custom
   format is developed using the raw deflate format for compressed data, it is
   recommended that a check value such as an Adler-32 or a CRC-32 be applied to
   the uncompressed data as is done in the zlib, gzip, and zip formats.  For
   most applications, the zlib format should be used as is.  Note that comments
   above on the use in deflateInit2() applies to the magnitude of windowBits.

     windowBits can also be greater than 15 for optional gzip decoding.  Add
   32 to windowBits to enable zlib and gzip decoding with automatic header
   detection, or add 16 to decode only the gzip format (the zlib format will
   return a Z_DATA_ERROR).  If a gzip stream is being decoded, strm->adler is a
   CRC-32 instead of an Adler-32.  Unlike the gunzip utility and gzread() (see
   below), inflate() will not automatically decode concatenated gzip streams.
   inflate() will return Z_STREAM_END at the end of the gzip stream.  The state
   would need to be reset to continue decoding a subsequent gzip stream.

     inflateInit2 returns Z_OK if success, Z_MEM_ERROR if there was not enough
   memory, Z_VERSION_ERROR if the zlib library version is incompatible with the
   version assumed by the caller, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the parameters are
   invalid, such as a null pointer to the structure.  msg is set to null if
   there is no error message.  inflateInit2 does not perform any decompression
   apart from possibly reading the zlib header if present: actual decompression
   will be done by inflate().  (So next_in and avail_in may be modified, but
   next_out and avail_out are unused and unchanged.) The current implementation
   of inflateInit2() does not process any header information -- that is
   deferred until inflate() is called.

/*
     This function returns two values, one in the lower 16 bits of the return
   value, and the other in the remaining upper bits, obtained by shifting the

   zero, then inflate() is currently decoding information outside of a block.
   If the upper value is -1 and the lower value is non-zero, then inflate is in
   the middle of a stored block, with the lower value equaling the number of
   bytes from the input remaining to copy.  If the upper value is not -1, then
   it is the number of bits back from the current bit position in the input of
   the code (literal or length/distance pair) currently being processed.  In
   that case the lower value is the number of bytes already emitted for that
   code.

     A code is being processed if inflate is waiting for more input to complete
   decoding of the code, or if it has completed decoding but is waiting for
   more output space to write the literal or match data.

     inflateMark() is used to mark locations in the input data for random
   access, which may be at bit positions, and to note those cases where the
   output of a code may span boundaries of random access blocks.  The current

int inflateGetHeader(z_streamp strm, gz_headerp head);
/*
     inflateGetHeader() requests that gzip header information be stored in the
   provided gz_header structure.  inflateGetHeader() may be called after
   inflateInit2() or inflateReset(), and before the first call of inflate().
   As inflate() processes the gzip stream, head->done is zero until the header
   is completed, at which time head->done is set to one.  If a zlib stream is
   being decoded, then head->done is set to -1 to indicate that there will be
   no gzip header information forthcoming.  Note that Z_BLOCK or Z_TREES can be
   used to force inflate() to return immediately after header processing is
   complete and before any actual data is decompressed.

     The text, time, xflags, and os fields are filled in with the gzip header
   contents.  hcrc is set to true if there is a header CRC.  (The header CRC
   was valid if done is set to one.) If extra is not Z_NULL, then extra_max
   contains the maximum number of bytes to write to extra.  Once done is true,
   extra_len contains the actual extra field length, and extra contains the
   extra field, or that field truncated if extra_max is less than extra_len.
   If name is not Z_NULL, then up to name_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than name_max.  If
   comment is not Z_NULL, then up to comm_max characters are written there,
   terminated with a zero unless the length is greater than comm_max.  When any
   of extra, name, or comment are not Z_NULL and the respective field is not
   present in the header, then that field is set to Z_NULL to signal its
   absence.  This allows the use of deflateSetHeader() with the returned
   structure to duplicate the header.  However if those fields are set to
   allocated memory, then the application will need to save those pointers
   elsewhere so that they can be eventually freed.

     If inflateGetHeader is not used, then the header information is simply
   discarded.  The header is always checked for validity, including the header
   CRC if present.  inflateReset() will reset the process to discard the header
   information.  The application would need to call inflateGetHeader() again to
   retrieve the header from the next gzip stream.

     inflateGetHeader returns Z_OK if success, or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the source
   stream state was inconsistent.

                void* in_desc,

                void* out_desc);
/*
     inflateBack() does a raw inflate with a single call using a call-back
   interface for input and output.  This is potentially more efficient than
   inflate() for file i/o applications, in that it avoids copying between the
   output and the sliding window by simply making the window itself the output
   buffer.  inflate() can be faster on modern CPUs when used with large
   buffers.  inflateBack() trusts the application to not change the output
   buffer passed by the output function, at least until inflateBack() returns.

     inflateBackInit() must be called first to allocate the internal state
   and to initialize the state with the user-provided window buffer.
   inflateBack() may then be used multiple times to inflate a complete, raw
   deflate stream with each call.  inflateBackEnd() is then called to free the
   allocated state.

     A raw deflate stream is one with no zlib or gzip header or trailer.
   This routine would normally be used in a utility that reads zip or gzip
   files and writes out uncompressed files.  The utility would decode the
   header and process the trailer on its own, hence this routine expects only
   the raw deflate stream to decompress.  This is different from the default
   behavior of inflate(), which expects a zlib header and trailer around the
   deflate stream.

     inflateBack() uses two subroutines supplied by the caller that are then
   called by inflateBack() for input and output.  inflateBack() calls those
   routines until it reads a complete deflate stream and writes out all of the
   uncompressed data, or until it encounters an error.  The function's
   parameters and return types are defined above in the in_func and out_func
   typedefs.  inflateBack() will call in(in_desc, &buf) which should return the
   number of bytes of provided input, and a pointer to that input in buf.  If
   there is no input available, in() must return zero -- buf is ignored in that
   case -- and inflateBack() will return a buffer error.  inflateBack() will
   call out(out_desc, buf, len) to write the uncompressed data buf[0 .. len-1].
   out() should return zero on success, or non-zero on failure.  If out()
   returns non-zero, inflateBack() will return with an error.  Neither in() nor
   out() are permitted to change the contents of the window provided to
   inflateBackInit(), which is also the buffer that out() uses to write from.
   The length written by out() will be at most the window size.  Any non-zero
   amount of input may be provided by in().

     For convenience, inflateBack() can be provided input on the first call by
   setting strm->next_in and strm->avail_in.  If that input is exhausted, then
   in() will be called.  Therefore strm->next_in must be initialized before
   calling inflateBack().  If strm->next_in is Z_NULL, then in() will be called
   immediately for input.  If strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then strm->avail_in
   must also be initialized, and then if strm->avail_in is not zero, input will
   initially be taken from strm->next_in[0 ..  strm->avail_in - 1].

     The in_desc and out_desc parameters of inflateBack() is passed as the
   first parameter of in() and out() respectively when they are called.  These
   descriptors can be optionally used to pass any information that the caller-
   supplied in() and out() functions need to do their job.

     On return, inflateBack() will set strm->next_in and strm->avail_in to
   pass back any unused input that was provided by the last in() call.  The
   return values of inflateBack() can be Z_STREAM_END on success, Z_BUF_ERROR
   if in() or out() returned an error, Z_DATA_ERROR if there was a format error
   in the deflate stream (in which case strm->msg is set to indicate the nature
   of the error), or Z_STREAM_ERROR if the stream was not properly initialized.
   In the case of Z_BUF_ERROR, an input or output error can be distinguished
   using strm->next_in which will be Z_NULL only if in() returned an error.  If
   strm->next_in is not Z_NULL, then the Z_BUF_ERROR was due to out() returning
   non-zero.  (in() will always be called before out(), so strm->next_in is
   assured to be defined if out() returns non-zero.)  Note that inflateBack()
   cannot return Z_OK.

   wrapper, documented in RFC 1952, wrapped around a deflate stream.

gzFile gzopen(const(char)* path, const(char)* mode);
/*
     Opens a gzip (.gz) file for reading or writing.  The mode parameter is as
   in fopen ("rb" or "wb") but can also include a compression level ("wb9") or
   a strategy: 'f' for filtered data as in "wb6f", 'h' for Huffman-only
   compression as in "wb1h", 'R' for run-length encoding as in "wb1R", or 'F'
   for fixed code compression as in "wb9F".  (See the description of
   deflateInit2 for more information about the strategy parameter.)  'T' will
   request transparent writing or appending with no compression and not using
   the gzip format.

     "a" can be used instead of "w" to request that the gzip stream that will
   be written be appended to the file.  "+" will result in an error, since
   reading and writing to the same gzip file is not supported.  The addition of
   "x" when writing will create the file exclusively, which fails if the file
   already exists.  On systems that support it, the addition of "e" when
   reading or writing will set the flag to close the file on an execve() call.

     These functions, as well as gzip, will read and decode a sequence of gzip
   streams in a file.  The append function of gzopen() can be used to create
   such a file.  (Also see gzflush() for another way to do this.)  When
   appending, gzopen does not test whether the file begins with a gzip stream,
   nor does it look for the end of the gzip streams to begin appending.  gzopen
   will simply append a gzip stream to the existing file.

     gzopen can be used to read a file which is not in gzip format; in this
   case gzread will directly read from the file without decompression.  When
   reading, this will be detected automatically by looking for the magic two-
   byte gzip header.

     gzopen returns NULL if the file could not be opened, if there was
   insufficient memory to allocate the gzFile state, or if an invalid mode was
   specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not provided, or '+' was provided).
   errno can be checked to determine if the reason gzopen failed was that the
   file could not be opened.
*/

gzFile gzdopen(int fd, const(char)* mode);
/*
     gzdopen associates a gzFile with the file descriptor fd.  File descriptors
   are obtained from calls like open, dup, creat, pipe or fileno (if the file
   has been previously opened with fopen).  The mode parameter is as in gzopen.

     The next call of gzclose on the returned gzFile will also close the file
   descriptor fd, just like fclose(fdopen(fd, mode)) closes the file descriptor
   fd.  If you want to keep fd open, use fd = dup(fd_keep); gz = gzdopen(fd,
   mode);.  The duplicated descriptor should be saved to avoid a leak, since
   gzdopen does not close fd if it fails.  If you are using fileno() to get the
   file descriptor from a FILE *, then you will have to use dup() to avoid
   double-close()ing the file descriptor.  Both gzclose() and fclose() will
   close the associated file descriptor, so they need to have different file
   descriptors.

     gzdopen returns NULL if there was insufficient memory to allocate the
   gzFile state, if an invalid mode was specified (an 'r', 'w', or 'a' was not
   provided, or '+' was provided), or if fd is -1.  The file descriptor is not
   used until the next gz* read, write, seek, or close operation, so gzdopen
   will not detect if fd is invalid (unless fd is -1).

   default buffer size is 8192 bytes.  This function must be called after

   file.  The buffer memory allocation is always deferred to the first read or
   write.  Three times that size in buffer space is allocated.  A larger buffer
   size of, for example, 64K or 128K bytes will noticeably increase the speed
   of decompression (reading).

     The new buffer size also affects the maximum length for gzprintf().

int gzread(gzFile file, void* buf, uint len);
/*
     Reads the given number of uncompressed bytes from the compressed file.  If
   the input file is not in gzip format, gzread copies the given number of
   bytes into the buffer directly from the file.

     After reaching the end of a gzip stream in the input, gzread will continue
   to read, looking for another gzip stream.  Any number of gzip streams may be
   concatenated in the input file, and will all be decompressed by gzread().
   If something other than a gzip stream is encountered after a gzip stream,
   that remaining trailing garbage is ignored (and no error is returned).

     gzread can be used to read a gzip file that is being concurrently written.
   Upon reaching the end of the input, gzread will return with the available
   data.  If the error code returned by gzerror is Z_OK or Z_BUF_ERROR, then
   gzclearerr can be used to clear the end of file indicator in order to permit
   gzread to be tried again.  Z_OK indicates that a gzip stream was completed
   on the last gzread.  Z_BUF_ERROR indicates that the input file ended in the
   middle of a gzip stream.  Note that gzread does not return -1 in the event
   of an incomplete gzip stream.  This error is deferred until gzclose(), which
   will return Z_BUF_ERROR if the last gzread ended in the middle of a gzip
   stream.  Alternatively, gzerror can be used before gzclose to detect this
   case.

     gzread returns the number of uncompressed bytes actually read, less than
   len for end of file, or -1 for error.  If len is too large to fit in an int,
   then nothing is read, -1 is returned, and the error state is set to
   Z_STREAM_ERROR.

   z_size_t is identical to size_t.  If not, then z_size_t is an unsigned
   integer type that can contain a pointer.

     gzfread() returns the number of full items read of size size, or zero if
   the end of the file was reached and a full item could not be read, or if
   there was an error.  gzerror() must be consulted if zero is returned in

     In the event that the end of file is reached and only a partial item is
   available at the end, i.e. the remaining uncompressed data length is not a
   multiple of size, then the final partial item is nevetheless read into buf
   and the end-of-file flag is set.  The length of the partial item read is not
   provided, but could be inferred from the result of gztell().  This behavior
   is the same as the behavior of fread() implementations in common libraries,
